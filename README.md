# Employee Engagement & Rewards Analytics Dashboard

This project breaks down how employees participate in different programs, how they earn points, and how often they redeem rewards. I created the full SQL database from scratch, added sample data, and used Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) to analyze participation, redemption trends, and overall engagement. The goal was to understand which programs attract people, what rewards get redeemed the most, and how activity changes over time.

The dashboard includes:
- Participation per program
- Reward redemption distribution
- Monthly redemption trends

This project helped me practice SQL querying, joins, grouping, and building simple data visuals in Python. It also shows how data can tell a story about engagement inside a company.
